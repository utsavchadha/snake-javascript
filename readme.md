Snake game in plain javascript

This game is meant to be played on the browser. It can be played in Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer (IE9 or above). IE8 does not support html canvas, which is used for building the game.

To play the game, follow the instructions below :
1. Download the entire folder via github or download the snake.zip file.
2. Double click the index.html file in the snake folder to launch it in your default browser.
3. Use the arrow keys to initiate the game.

This is a very basic version of the game written entirely in javascript and html. Next steps would be:
1. Add stylesheets so as to stylize the entire window and not just the canvas.
2. Add a pacing mechanism so that the snake speeds up as the score increases.
3. Add an overlay for the instruction prompts at the start and end of the game. Overlaid prompts are much more intuitive for the user.
