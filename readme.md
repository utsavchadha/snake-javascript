**Snake game in plain javascript**

This is a very simple version of the classic arcade snake game. It was written primarily using javascript and html canvas.

This game is meant to be played on a web browser. It can be played in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer (IE9 or above). IE8 does not inherently support html canvas and needs external libraries for canvas to work.

To play the game, follow the instructions below :
1. Download the entire folder via github or download the snake.zip file.
2. Double click the index.html file in the snake folder to launch it in your default browser.
3. Use the arrow keys to initiate the game.

Next steps would be:
1. Add stylesheets so as to stylize the entire window and not just the canvas.
2. Add a pacing mechanism so that the snake speeds up as the score increases.
3. Add an overlay for the instruction prompts at the start and end of the game. Overlaid prompts are much more intuitive for the user.
4. Add animations and a high score counter to make the game more engaging.
